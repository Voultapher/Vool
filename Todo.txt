TaskQueue:
Optimize async_task size
Reduce queue_loop function size, maybe split into multiple functions
Add test which demonstates that adding tasks can be done from multiple threads without external
synchronisation
Add test to see if there could be problem with nonaligned memory,
x86-64 gurantes that reading an int while writing should not corrupt the data, this does not
hold true for every platform, nor unaligned types.

TestSuit:
Make it moveable

Vecmap:
Check if using an unordered_map under with size_t as key and value as value,
and storing the key in Bucket instead of a pointer is beneficial.
There may be a memory leak.
